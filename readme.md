## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### **1. Using `example.sqm` in Eden Editor**
If you want to manually place a billboard and adjust settings:
1. Copy the `example.sqm` file into your mission folder.
2. Open Arma 3 **Eden Editor**.
3. Load the mission and customize billboard placement.
4. Save and **export as a `.pbo`** for server use.

### **2. Spawning a Billboard Dynamically**
If you prefer to spawn billboards at runtime:
1. Add `billboard_spawn.sqf` to your mission folder.
2. Open the **Debug Console** in Arma 3 and run:
   ```sqf
   [] execVM "a3_billboards-main/scripts/billboard_spawn.sqf";
   ```
3. The billboard will be placed at predefined coordinates.

### **3. Applying a Custom Texture to a Billboard**
To apply a texture to an existing billboard:
1. Add `object_texture.sqf` to your mission folder.
2. Run the following in the **Debug Console**:
   ```sqf
   [] execVM "a3_billboards-main/scripts/object_texture.sqf";
   ```
3. All nearby billboards will be updated with the custom texture.

## ðŸ”§ Customization
- Edit `example.sqm` to change the **billboardâ€™s position, angle, and texture**.
- Modify `billboard_spawn.sqf` to spawn multiple billboards dynamically.
- Replace `example.paa` with your own `.paa` texture to customize the billboard appearance.
